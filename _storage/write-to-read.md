# Storage write and read

Once a user authenticates and a DApp obtains authentication, the application interacts with Gai through the blockstack.js library. There are two simple methods for working with data in Gaia hub the `putFile()` and `getFile()` methods. This section goes into greater detail about the methods, how they interact with a hub, and how to use them.


## Write-to and Read-from URL Guarantees

Gaia is built on a driver model that supports many storage services. So, with very few lines of code, you can interact with providers on Amazon S3, Drop, and so forth.  The simple getFile and putFile interfaces are kept simple because Blockstack assumes and wants to encourage a community of OS data management libraries.

The performance and simplicity oriented guarantee of the Gaia specification is
that when an application submits a write-to the
`https://myhub.service.org/store/foo/bar` URL, the application is guaranteed to
be able to read from the `https://myreads.com/foo/bar` URL. Note that, while the prefix in the write-to url (`myhub.service.org/store`) and the read-from URL (`https://myreads.com`) are different, the `foo/bar` suffixes are the same.

Consistent, identical suffixes allow an application to know _exactly_ where a
written file can be read from, given the read prefix. The Gaia service defines a `hub_info` endpoint to obtain that read prefix:

```
GET /hub_info/
```

The endpoint returns a JSON object with a `read_url_prefix`, for example, if my service returns:

```javascript
{ ...,
  "read_url_prefix": "https://myservice.org/read/"
}
```

The data be read with this `getFile()` and this address:

```
https://myservice.org/read/1DHvWDj834zPAkwMhpXdYbCYh4PomwQfzz/0/profile.json
```

The application is guaranteed that the profile is written with `putFile()` this request address:

```
https://myservice.org/store/1DHvWDj834zPAkwMhpXdYbCYh4PomwQfzz/0/profile.json
```

When you use the `putFile()` method it takes the user data and POSTs it to the user's Gaia storage hub. The data POSTs directly to the hub, the blockchain is not used and no data is stored there.


## Address-based access-control

Access control in a Gaia storage hub is performed on a per-address basis.
Writes to URLs `/store/<address>/<file>` are only allowed if the writer can
demonstrate that they control _that_ address. This is achieved via the
authentication token which is a message _signed_ by the private key associated
with that address. The message itself is a challenge-text, returned via the
`/hub_info/` endpoint.
